I have an Angular application with an Address component. Assist in generating manual test cases for address component present it in a tabular format so that it can be directly exported to Excel.

Guidelines for Test Case Creation:
- Create one end to end regression test case at the bottom
- Comprehensive Test Data: Use all possible combinations of test data including positive and negative scenarios.
- Test Case Structure: Each test case should include a description,test case type that is functional or - regression, test summary, test steps, test case ID, and expected results.

Generate Manual test cases based on below acceptance criteria:
i. The addresstype dropdown should have only two options "Home" and  "Work".
ii. The Street field should not be null.
iii. The Pin Code should start with "421".
iv. The country dropdown should have only two options "Canada" and  "USA" and it should be appeared in alphabetical order. 
v. I should see only canadian province when i select Canada  in country dropdown and same is applicable for USA
